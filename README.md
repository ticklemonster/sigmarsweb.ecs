# Sigmar's Web

A (rather ordinary) web-based clone of Sigmar's Garden from the (quite excellent) game, Opus Magnum.
If you don't already know how to play the game - go and buy the original!

This is an exercise for my own learning, but is relatively complete and functional.
It was refactored in an attempt to take an _Entity-Component-System_ type approach, with PIXI.js as the renderer.
